- Since January, a certain amount of Igalia's test262 development has been subsidized by [Sovereign Tech Fund](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/).
- You may have noticed that many more tests landed in Q1 2024 than in Q4 2023
- Worked with proposal authors to review tests and ensure coverage for **RegExp modifiers** and **Set methods**
- Wrote tests for a [needs-consensus PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2600) that had long been blocked on test coverage
- We'd like to encourage proposals to help write **testing plans**. Providing good documentation for this is high on our list. Let us know what you think about this!
