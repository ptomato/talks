# âŒš **Temporal**

**Philip Chimento**
Igalia, in partnership with Bloomberg  
TC39 April 2024

---

## Progress update

After 7 years, Temporal is close to done. Our only focus is making sure in-progress implementations are successful:

- Fixing small numbers of bugs found by implementors, mostly in corner cases
- Making targeted changes to reduce complexity to make implementations easier
- Addressing non-feature-specific implementation concerns, e.g. code size

---

## We need your help!

- We would like to make sure doubts are addressed before the June 2024 plenary, so there are no remaining obstacles to implementation
- If something is preventing you from implementing Temporal, let us know and work with us to resolve ASAP
- Don't wait! If we need to make changes, we want to make them now

You are welcome at the **Temporal champions meeting, biweekly Thursdays at 08:00 Pacific** (or we will happily meet another time if this time doesn't work for you)

<!--
1 normative change proposed today for bug caught by a polyfill implementor
-->

---

## Implementor concerns

- Concerns raised about the size of Temporal
- Discussed in hallway during February plenary
- V8: Concerns about compiled binary size on 32-bit Android ([#2786](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2786))
  - We made a proof of concept showing how to cut binary size up to 38% with no change in functionality
- JavaScriptCore: General concerns about standard library growth, but not specifically about Temporal
- (cont'd)

---

## Implementor concerns (2)

- SpiderMonkey: Concerns about Firefox installer size
- V8: Concerns about complexity of proposal
- Polyfill: Newly discovered bugs in duration arithmetic
- Considering dropping or reducing:
  - User-defined calendars and time zones, associated subclassing?
  - `relativeTo` parameter in Duration.p.add/subtract?
- Open to suggestions. It helps us if concerns can be made specific

# Normative change

## Bug in rounding edge cases (PR [#2797](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2797))

When rounding a ZonedDateTime to the day boundary, it was possible in rare cases due to DST to add a spurious extra day.

```js
const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2024-03-10T23:00:01[America/New_York]')
zdt.round({ smallestUnit: 'day', roundingMode: 'ceil' })
  // Current: 2024-03-12T00:00:00-04:00[America/New_York] (incorrect)
  // Proposed: 2024-03-11T00:00:00-04:00[America/New_York] (correct)
```
The incorrect result comes from not taking into account that 23:00:01 is 22h 1s into a 23-hour day. (March 10th was DST "spring forward".)

(Discovered by Adam Shaw, a polyfill implementor)

# Proposed summary for notes

> Consensus was reached on a normative change to fix a bug in rounding that occurred in rare cases having to do with DST.
> Over the next few weeks, we plan to dig into remaining concerns from TC39 delegates, particularly with the goal of reducing complexity.
> Follow the checklist in [#2628](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2628) for updates.
