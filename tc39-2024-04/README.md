## Bug in rounding edge cases (PR [#2797](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2797))

When rounding a ZonedDateTime to the day boundary, it was possible in rare cases due to DST to add a spurious extra day.

```js
const zdt0 = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2024-03-10T23:00:01[America/New_York]')
zdt0.round({ smallestUnit: 'day', roundingMode: 'ceil' })
  // Current: 2024-03-12T00:00:00-04:00[America/New_York] (incorrect)
  // Proposed: 2024-03-11T00:00:00-04:00[America/New_York] (correct)
```
The incorrect result comes from not taking into account that 23:00:01 is 22h 1s into a 23-hour day. (March 10th was DST "spring forward".)

(Discovered by Adam Shaw, a polyfill implementor)

# Proposed summary for notes

> Consensus was reached on a normative change to fix a bug in rounding that occurred in rare cases having to do with DST.
> The proposal champions are not aware of any further outstanding bugs<!--, and expect implementations to be able to use the proposal as a stable base in the coming weeks with only editorial changes expected-->. Follow the checklist in [#2628](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2628) for updates.
