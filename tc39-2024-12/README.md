# 🌒 **ShadowRealm** 🌘
## for Stage 3

# Recap: What is ShadowRealm?

A mechanism to execute JavaScript code within the context of a new global object and set of built-ins.

Goal is not **security**, but **integrity**: complete control over the execution environment.

```js
globalThis.someValue = 1;
const realm = new ShadowRealm();
realm.evaluate(`globalThis.someValue = 2;`);
console.assert(globalThis.someValue === 1);
```

# Recap: Proposal history

- Everything revolves around the question [**Which web APIs should be present inside ShadowRealm**](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm/issues/393)?
- Several different ways of answering this question have been proposed and rejected:
  - "None"
  - A vetted list
  - A criterion based on confidentiality

---

# Recap: Proposal history

- **Sept. 2023**: Stage 2, readvancement pending explicit support from two implementations that the testing and list of APIs to be exposed to ShadowRealms are sufficient
- **Feb. 2024**: Stage 2.7, with the understanding that stage 3 requires signoff from HTML folks on the HTML integration, as well as resolution of Mozilla's concerns about test coverage
- Not an opportunity to relitigate previous design decisions

---

# Today: Exposed web APIs

**Which web APIs should be present inside ShadowRealm?**

- New W3C TAG [design principle](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-principles/pull/510):
  - Only purely computational features are exposed everywhere
    - not performing I/O
    - not affecting the state of the user agent or the user's device
  - Exception: Anything relying on an event loop is not exposed
  - Expose conservatively: features primarily useful for unexposed feature are not exposed

---

# Today: Exposed web APIs

- Developed based on a number of conversations with implementors and web platform experts
- Clear criterion to decide whether something is in or out
- Distinction between "which standards body standardized a feature" is irrelevant

---

# Today: HTML integration

- Pull request: [whatwg/html#9893](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9893)
- Design settled and reviews have occurred
- Fixing details
- Some mechanical work needed in specs downstream of HTML to use new terminology

---

# Today: Test coverage

- ✅ Remove tests for things no longer exposed under the criterion

---

# Requirements for stage 3

- ✅ The feature has sufficient testing and appropriate pre-implementation experience 

**Specific to ShadowRealm**
- Explicit support from two implementations that the testing and list of APIs to be exposed to ShadowRealms are sufficient
- Signoff from HTML folks on the HTML integration
- Resolution of Mozilla's concerns about test coverage
